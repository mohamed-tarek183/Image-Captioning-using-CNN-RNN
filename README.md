# Image-Captioning-using-CNN-RNN
This project focuses on building an automatic image captioning system that
generates natural language descriptions for given images. The model uses a deep learning pipeline combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for visual feature extraction and Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs) for caption generation
